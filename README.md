# weather-api

In this homework I use Fetch and Ajax to get data from different apis for a weather app.
This website allows you to input any city in American and will give you the weather forcast for the next 5 days
You can clear the search bar
The cards that display the 5 day forcast will show temperature humidity Uv index and Date.
You press the search button when you finished typing in t he city you wanted when the search bar has different citys in it you can click on their names to cycle thru the different weather forcasts.
